# roetisserie
Inventory and sales management for LuLaRoe consultants.

## Running the app
`cd roetisserie && npm start`

The MeteorJS server will start up, and then open the OS default browser
to connect to the server (running as `localhost`). The Roetisserie page should
be visible immediately in the browser window.

_Special thanks to my wife, Kristen, who works so hard for our family._
